# Differences between Emerging and Developed markets
<p align="justify">
This repository aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic linkages among stock market indices from emerging and developed countries. The dataset consists of four emerging (Brazil, China, Greece, India) and two developed (the US, Germany) markets that span a period between January 2016 and April 2023.

The relationship between international markets is an important issue for investors and researchers. Global markets present complex dynamics and 
interdependences, forming a dynamic ecosystem where various financial products and assets interact. Markets are distinguished between developed
and emerging according to their economic stability, political risk, financial system maturity, and market regulatory framework. Generally, developing
markets tend to have higher systematic risk and growth expectations. To reduce the diversifiable risk and gain higher returns, portfolio managers 
add stocks from emerging markets to portfolios that contain financial products from advanced markets. However, financial liberalization and global 
trade agreements made financial markets more cointegrated. Consequently, the information transmission among the international stock markets can 
cause a financial contagious effect that vanishes potential diversification opportunities.

<u>The primary objectives are threefold:</u>  
1) A comparison between the different time-series dynamics and relationships between emerging and advanced markets will be conducted.  
2) Reliable predictors will be investigated, in a view to incorporate them as part of a short-term forecasting procedure.  
3) The time-varying relationship between market indices from emerging markets and the S&P 500 will be quantified, aiming to assess the integration of emerging markets into portfolio optimization strategies for American investors.
     
<u>Limitations:</u>
1) Limited number of markets that were examined.
2) Only one date is suggested for the cut-off, and the cut-off happens around a time of great volatility.
3) The forecasts are flat and the models do not capture the different trends.
4) Arbitrary selection of the rolling window size, without implementing any Monte Carlo simulation or Cross-Validation technique.
